**Internal API Proxy Transformer** is a lightweight internal service I developed at my current company to solve a data integration challenge under tight constraints. The company did not want to invest in developing new backend APIs, so I created a Node.js service that periodically fetches JSON data from an internal web page using cron jobs, transforms and enriches the structure (e.g., adds missing `description` fields, renames unclear keys), and exposes a cleaned, structured internal API.

This allowed our Taiwan team to reliably consume up-to-date data without requiring changes to the legacy system.

**ðŸ”§ What It Does:**
- Fetches JSON data from internal web pages that do not have dedicated APIs
- Transforms the data (e.g., enriches with new fields, restructures for clarity)
- Exposes a new internal API for consumption by cross-regional teams
- Runs automatically on a defined schedule using CronJob

**ðŸ›  Tech Stack:**
- Node.js + Express
- CronJob (node-cron)
- HTTP/JSON request and parsing
- Internal hosting environment

**ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:**
- Designing pragmatic solutions within organizational limitations
- Implementing automated data enrichment pipelines
- Building internal middleware to connect systems and teams without disrupting upstream sources
